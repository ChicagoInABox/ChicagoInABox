                    Chicago In A Box all started from an idea I had seen on <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit.</a> A guy had posted about his company called <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2i1esf/just_launched_an_online_business_and_have_just/">Balitmore in a box.</a>
                    I thought to my self, Baltimore in a box? Chicago is way cooler than Baltimore, lets make Chicago In A Box!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    With that in mind, I set out to build this site along with an assortment of Chicago flavored goodies. I wanted to show people the heart of Chicago.
                    Give them something intimate, and make them smile. As a Chicagoan, there are certain things that distinctly remind me of The Windy City, I wanted to find those little pieces of history, and put them in a box.

                Take a dive into the box and see what Chicago has to offer:
